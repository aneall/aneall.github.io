## An Introduction
[My Personal Website!](https://aneall.github.io) is a work-in-progress portfolio to showcase my work related to:
- XR (research, computer graphics and vision projects, 3D modeling and animation, 2D design, and Unity development)
- BCIs (neuroscience expertise and hardware projects)
- Applied Engineering (design and fabrication of, for example, a low-cost optical system)! 

## Homepage
If you pay close attention, you'll notice three things:
1. Your cursor is a cute little png of flowers (which I designed)
2. My picture is one that I captured and edited myself
3. If you click on this picture, a new option in the GUI will appear to [Enter](https://ashleyinvr.glitch.me) – *would recommened entering if you want to experience my WebXR + WebGL skills directly!*
